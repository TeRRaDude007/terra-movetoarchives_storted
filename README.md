Created a script that automatically sorts music alphabetically from a specified directory with the option to select /A or /_A in your archive folders.

If the alphabet folders are not present, it will automatically create them with the correct chmod and if the music is already present in the archive, you can specify a folder where it will move the duplicates so you can sort them out later.

The script has a sandbox on or off to test everything and log the results before going live, so you know exactly what the script does.

You can run it manually in shell or via a cronjob.
